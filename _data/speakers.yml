        title: "Working Compassionately with Legacy Code"
        abstract: "Your code is your partner. It struggles against you, but also alongside you. Your code comes to you as it is, not as you wish it were. Like a real-life partner, it has a history that you’ll never fully know; like a real-life child, it bears your imprint, but it is wild, unruly, and fiercely self-sovereign. You’ll never stop working with code that’s hard to figure out or difficult to change. But this code, this stubborn creature, is entrusted to you. Let go of your anger at the developer who wrote it. Let go of the terror of being blamed for its unforeseeable regressions. Let go--and find joy."

        title: "The Social Responsibility of Coding"
        abstract: "The power of technology is in its vast reach and scale, as well as its adaptability. We build fast and break things, but what happens when we build fast and make decisions that have real-world ramifications? The impact of our work can be as small as only ourselves, or as large as the world. Understanding our social responsibility as creators is the first step to creating ethical, sustainable, and useful technology."

        title: "How to spy with Python"
        abstract: "In the past few years, individuals have come forward revealing that large governments have been spying on pretty much anyone and everyone. But what is actually going on? How does it affect you, and what can you do to protect yourself? And most importantly, how can *you* replicate what these governments are doing?! Obligatory disclaimer: I am not condoning spying on others!"

        title: "Kylie, Kanye, and the Super Bowl: Going big without going down"
        abstract: "From stores with ads in the Super Bowl to selling Kanye’s latest album, Shopify has built a name for itself handling some of the world’s largest flash sales. These high profile events generate write-heavy traffic that can be six times our platform’s baseline throughput. Needless to say, that kind of traffic doesn’t lend itself well to off-the-shelf solutions.<br><br>This talk is the story of how we engineered our platform to withstand large bursts of traffic. Since it’s not financially sound for Shopify to always run the required capacity, we used Lua to build queueing and caching layers into our Nginx load balancers. To guarantee these solutions worked, we tested them with a purpose-built load testing service.<br><br>Although flash sales are unique to commerce platforms, the lessons we learn from them are applicable to any services that experience bursts of traffic."

    -   name: Huma Zafar
        twitter: electricspectra
        bio: Tech Analyst at BiblioCommons, Huma prefers not to keep her hands still, whether that involves working on one of her many knitting and weaving projects, typing away at her keyboard as she plays with some new programming language, or gesturing wildly as she talks. She reads a lot.

        title: "Macros and Metaprogramming"
        abstract: "Ever wondered how macros really work? Or perhaps you've crafted many a crazy #define and want to take your macro knowledge to the next level? In this talk, we'll start with the basics and work up to the mechanics of different types of macros, look at the intersection of macros and functional languages, and finally, show some powerful ways we can use macros to extend an existing language."

Before *that*, he was working on getting the coveted engineering iron ring from uWaterloo until 2014. He can be seen mostly fiddling with said iron ring, and probably dropping it. Honestly, it's a miracle it isn't in a storm drain somewhere.

        title: "From Characters to Pixels: Math in Typography"
        abstract: "With nothing more than a font file, basic algebra, and a function to set the color of a pixel, you'll learn the mathematics behind how the letter e makes its way to your screen."

    -   name: Jessica Thompson
        twitter: tsonj
        bio: I am a PhD student at the International Laboratory for Brain, Music & Sound Research (BRAMS) and the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA). My research interests lay at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and machine learning. I’m interested in how deep learning can help us understand human brain function and also how measurements of brain activity can be leveraged to design and understand neuromorphic systems. Specifically, I try to discover the computational mechanisms underlying human auditory perception using computational modeling, deep learning and ultra high-field neuroimaging.

        title: "Words are Hard"
        abstract: "Software engineering is much more about talking with humans than writing code. But what happens when all of that communication takes place online?<br><br>In this talk, I'll talk about common scenarios that can be tricky to navigate in the digital world. We'll cover ways to get the most out of modern communication tools (Slack, GitHub, email, IM, etc.) and how to avoid being misunderstood when using these tools professionally.<br><br>Words can be hard, but they don't have to be."

        title: "Code is bad"
        abstract: "As developers, we get a kick out of building things from scratch. Once we start working with larger teams, though, it's important to understand the organizational cost of (re)building code from the ground up. This session aims to convince you that code sucks and the noblest aspiration is to write less."

        title: "Blockchains: How do they work?"
        abstract: "This talk will offer a high level overview of how blockchains work as a datastructure - focusing specifically on the bitcoin blockchain.  It will detail what a transaction is, how private/public keys are used in blockchain transactions, what mining is, and how proof of work is used to secure the network.  It will not, in any way, constitute investment advice."

    -   name: Prof. Sharief Oteafy

        title: "Etching your CS path: lessons from academia"
        abstract: "As a veteran of academia, and one of the final generation of pure-CS dinosaurs, I’ve seen quite a number of CS majors carve their way through diverse career paths. In a time of such potential, it is alarming to see many surrender to “conforming views” of what a CS major “must do”. We’ll talk about grad school, why and how you should approach it, and pursuing your unique impact in Computing. More importantly, we’ll talk about the road to finding your unique path among previous CS generations, and how to bridge and connect with those who often roll their eyes as they dub you… the Millennials (or Generation Z)!"
